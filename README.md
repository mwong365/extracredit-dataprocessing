How to run code:
Transfer all files into an IDE such as CLion and simply run main.cpp. Can edit code within main to change actions for transactions. 

Assignment Improvements:
I think the instructions should be more in depth, specifically regarding how the code will be tested. Providing a sample test files with test cases that imports the submitted class/code would help. Otherwise, I wasn't sure if I needed to implement an interface
for using the database, or if the TA's wwould just test using main.cpp given.
